# Health and Sleep Relation Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the relationship between sleep patterns and overall health using the "Health and Sleep Relation 2024" dataset. I will implement a neural network from scratch using Python and NumPy to uncover insights about how sleep quality and duration affect physical and mental well-being.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains detailed information on:
- Individual demographics (Person ID, Gender, Age)
- Occupation
- Sleep metrics (Duration, Quality)
- Health indicators (Physical Activity Level, Stress Level, BMI Category, Blood Pressure)

This rich dataset enables exploration of connections between sleep habits, lifestyle factors, and various health outcomes.

## Project Goals

- Discover meaningful relationships between sleep patterns and health metrics
- Build predictive models to understand how sleep quality influences overall health
- Implement a neural network from scratch to deepen understanding of ML fundamentals
- Provide actionable insights for improving sleep hygiene and health outcomes

## My Workflow Plan

### 1. Data Understanding
I'll begin by thoroughly examining the dataset structure, identifying variable types, and understanding the relationships between features. This will include checking for missing values and understanding the distribution of each variable.

### 2. Data Preparation
I'll clean the data, handle any missing values, and prepare it for analysis. This includes encoding categorical variables (Gender, BMI Category, Occupation) and normalizing numerical features.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis
I'll create visualizations to understand correlations between sleep metrics and health indicators. Key questions include:
- How does sleep duration correlate with stress levels?
- Is there a relationship between physical activity and sleep quality?
- Do specific occupations show distinct sleep patterns?

### 4. Neural Network Design
Based on insights from EDA, I'll design a neural network architecture appropriate for this health data analysis. I'll carefully consider input features, hidden layer configurations, and output predictions.

### 5. Model Implementation
I'll implement the neural network from scratch using NumPy, coding forward and backward propagation, loss functions, and optimization algorithms.

### 6. Training and Evaluation
I'll train the model using appropriate metrics and implement cross-validation to ensure robustness and prevent overfitting.

### 7. Model Optimization
I'll fine-tune hyperparameters and implement regularization techniques to improve model performance.

### 8. Results Interpretation
I'll analyze model performance and interpret findings in the context of sleep health, identifying key factors that influence sleep quality and duration.

### 9. Conclusions and Recommendations
Based on the analysis, I'll provide actionable recommendations for improving sleep hygiene and overall health.

## Progress Updates

I'll document my journey through each step of this process, sharing code, visualizations, and insights as I progress through the project.

## Tools and Technologies

- Python for data processing and analysis
- NumPy for neural network implementation
- Pandas for data manipulation
